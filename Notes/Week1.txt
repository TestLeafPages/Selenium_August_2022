Installed JDK 1.8

Human -> Computer
English -> Binary lang

JDK
JRE - Source code of java and other supported files 
JVM - Memory, Compiler, Other components

Environment variable?

IDE
Write - Editor
Correct - Compiler
Run - Execution
Output - Console
Notepad
javac file.java
java file.java




In java, we will write our code in Class.


A class is a block of code which consist of variables and methods or
data and actions.

If we want to do any actions using java we need class

Keywords
keywords always starts with a lower case
keywords should not be used for naming purpose
package -> defines the class belongs which package
public ->
class -> which creates a new class


Variables - Data
Data types
1. Primitive - 
2. Derived / user defined

Primitive data types
char - 'a', 'b', 'A', 'B', '1', '/', ' ', '/n', '/t'
2 -> binary
ASCII

1. Create a package week1.day1
2. Create a class Car
3. All data type variables

Access modifiers
public - any one inside my project can access
private - any one inside my class can access
package/default/no modifer - any one inside my package can access
protected

Operator
unary
++,--
Incremental operator
decremental operator

binary
Arithmetic operator
+,-,*,/,%
Relational operator
<,<=,>,>=,==,!=
Logical opertor
&& - AND logic 1 && logic 2 = both has to be satisfied
|| - OR  logic 1 || logic 2 = any one has to be satisfied
! - NOT !logic 1 -> Not satisfied
ternary






Recap week 1 day 1
Basics of java
JDK installation
JDK, JRE and JVM

IDE - Eclipse

Maven Project
package - should starts with a lower case
Class - should starts with a upper case
Class - Block of code which contains data (variables) and actions (methods).

Variables
Global/class-level variables
dataType variableName = value;

Primitive - byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char

Keywords 
package, class, public, private, protected, static, void,
if, byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char

main() -> ?

sysout -> ?

operators
-> unary -> ++,--  -> a++ & ++a
-> binary -> 
arithmetic -> +,-,*,/,% 
relational -> <,>,<=,>=,==,!=
logical -> &&, ||, !
-> ternary 

Conditional statements
If i want to make a decision
Voting both
1. if block alone
if(age > 18){
// true block
allowed to vote
}

program continues here....

2. Gender based condition
washroom
if and else
if(gender = male){
use male washroom
}else{
use female washroom
}

3. else if
ranking process in school
if (mark >= 90){
First class
} else if (90 > mark > 80){
Second class
} else if (80 > mark > 70){
Third class
} else if (mark < 35){
fail
}




method, object, array, loop and string
Methods
1. if the return type is void, you should not add return statement.
2. if the return type is not void, 
then mentioned return type should be returned.
3. return statement must be the last line of the method


Any args or variables created inside the method is called as 
method level variable.
The scope of or the validity of the method level variable is 
within the block. (out side the block it is invalid)



Object -> key to the class

Create a class Car
1. print Car brand
2. get car color
3. get car engine number
4. sub of numbers, mul of numbers, div of two numbers
5. main method -> call all the methods
Observe the output



Constructor
1. Constructor is a spl method which has class name as the method name
2. Constructor do not have any return type
3. Constructor is the gateway to the class
4. Constructor takes the parameter/arg to the class
5. if you have not given the constructor, java will create a virtual
default constructor for the class to create an object.

The constructor will give the ref of the class
new will create a new memory space in heap memory and 
store the ref of the class


Object of the class also called as reference var or instance var


Array
Array is a concept of storing homogenous type of data.
259619 -  names
String name1 = "a";

names = [a,b,c,d,e,...];
Disadvantages of arrays
1. Arrays needs size explicitly or implicitly
2. Arrays can not be extended or shrinked dynamically


1. Print Odd numbers from 51 to 77
2. [22,67,98,1,34,58,99] -> second largest number? -> 98

String
We are going to learn the methods in the string class to manipulate
the String values.
String is immutable in nature.
